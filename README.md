## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
The only advise I could reccomend that is a very interesting service that I have only seen one company do which is rounding up the rest of your change from every transaction 
that you make and investing that money as well. The company that first started doing that was Acorns.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I think that offers an easy way for people with low income or low sources of money to invest since it doesnt feel that bad since you are only investing your change essentially
but that can quickly start to add up.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
the only technology that would be required is being able to look at a persons transaction history from banks and credit cards, this which betterment can already do since they 
track your spending.
